Feature: Format options
  In order to optimize behat output
  As a tester
  I need to be able to set options on behat runner

  Background:
    Given I initialise the working directory from the "FormatOptions" fixtures folder
    And I provide the following options for all behat invocations:
      | option      | value |
      | --no-colors |       |

  Scenario: --no-colors option
    When I run "behat --snippets-for=FeatureContext --snippets-type=regex"
    Then it should fail with:
